# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component: unexpected navigation failures.  The problem is that the `Link` component's `href` prop, when pointing to specific routes, doesn't work correctly in the deployed environment. 

## Problem Description

The `MyComponent` attempts to create links to `/` and `/about` using `next/link`. In the development environment, these links function correctly. However, once deployed, clicking these links fails to navigate to the intended pages.

## Solution

The solution involves adding `basePath` to the `next.config.js` file. The `basePath` parameter allows you to deploy the project into a subpath of the domain.
